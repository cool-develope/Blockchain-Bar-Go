## Installation

### Install Go 1.14 or higher
Follow the official docs or use your favorite dependency manager
to install Go: [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Verify your `$GOPATH` is correctly set before continuing!

### Setup this repository

Go is bit picky about where you store your repositories.

The convention is to store:
- the source code inside the `$GOPATH/src`
- the compiled program binaries inside the `$GOPATH/bin`

#### Using Git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cool-develope/Blockchain-Bar-Go.git
```
